# Todos 

## Optimizations
- Service tracks only messages after startup - on a crash / restart messages will be lost
- Service is standalone - cannot request messages from other nodes
- Filtering by errors
- Filtering by container
- Separate log for error messages (deep storage)
- Search not yet copied logs too (deep log)
