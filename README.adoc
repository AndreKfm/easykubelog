= EasyLog

Easy logging for Kubernetes

[WARNING]
[RED]*!! Pre-Alpha version so don't use in production !!*




[#Quickstart]
[indent=2]
== Quickstart

*Start on single node Kubernetes clusters*

  kubectl apply -f EasyLogService.yaml

**Start instance on each node with Daemonset for multi node clusters**

  kubectl apply -f DaemonSetEasyLogService.yaml

*Connect to EasyLog*

  https://nodeurl:30880


== Features of alpha version

* Tracking logs of each node
* Copy logs to a rotating internal log, configurable size
* Doesn't block other containers
* Search in content of copied logs
* Search by date / time
* Display container names, date time, log content 
* Https - internal certificate used for encryption only out of the box
* Small image size (Alpine)
* Source code MIT License
* Demonset - to install on each node - no central yet
* Docker image and yaml for easy Kubernetes installation 
* Auto detect log format (Docker / CRI)
* Simple installation
* No changes in container source code needed

== What's missing

* Central logging
* Central query
* Filter on container names
* Import / Export
* Track last read position - starts always to read from end of logs
* Query log history (of containers) not copied to central log
* Further documentation 
* User management 
* Authentication / Authorization

== Some notes

EasyLog was written to be easy to use and to do nothing more than 
what it should do - track the logs of a Kubernetes cluster, aggregate them 
and enable simple search over that log files. 

Some features are missing and will be added soon. 
I try to answer questions, also to check pull requests - but please
give me time for answering and checking.

Bug reports are always welcome, same as feature requests and other suggestions.
